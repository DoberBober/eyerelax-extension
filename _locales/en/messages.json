To do this, look through the screen (the principle of operation is the same as when viewing stereo images).</li><li>Both circles should be blurred, and in the center, between them, a clear third circle will appear.</li><li>Slowly move the screen away while keeping the circles merged.</li><li>Repeat a few times to learn how to easily join circles.</li></ul><p>Workout time - 1-3 minutes. If you can't keep the circles together all this time, slow down.</p><blockquote>A common mistake: the left eye looks at the right circle, and the right eye looks at the left one. To check if you make such a mistake, after joining the circles, close your left eye. The open right eye should look at the right circle. <b>Otherwise, the effect of training will be the opposite.</b></blockquote>"
